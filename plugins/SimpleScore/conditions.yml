## Conditions (https://github.com/r4g3baby/SimpleScore/blob/main/src/main/resources/conditions.yml)
# This is where you specify conditions to be used on scoreboards and scores.

# You can create a condition by creating a node with the condition name and
# then specifying the "type" and the required attributes for that type.
#
# List of available types (attributes with an = are optional and default to the value shown after):
# - HAS_PERMISSION (attributes: permission)
#   - Checks if the player has the specified permission
# - GREATER_THAN, LESS_THAN (attributes: input, value, orEqual=false)
#   - Performs the specified operation between the input and value
#   - You can use placeholders/variables in the input attribute
#   - You can set orEqual to return true if they are equal
# - EQUALS, CONTAINS, ENDS_WITH, STARTS_WITH (attributes: input, value, ignoreCase=false)
#   - Performs the specified operation between the input and value
#   - You can use placeholders/variables in the input attribute
#   - You can set ignoreCase to true to make the operation case-insensitive
#
# Check out the examples bellow for more information.

# This condition is true when the player has the specified permission
hasPermission:
  type: HAS_PERMISSION
  permission: 'simplescore.example.condition'

# This condition is true when the player world equals to "world"
isOverworld:
  type: EQUALS
  input: '%world%'
  value: 'world'

# This condition is true when the player world equals to "world_the_end"
isTheEnd:
  type: EQUALS
  input: '%world%'
  value: 'world_the_end'

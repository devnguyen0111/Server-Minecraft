# The format here is "<world name>: [ <list of scoreboards> ]"
# World Names:
# - Can use regex to match multiple worlds at once.
# - All world names are case-insensitive.
# - Worlds match from top to bottom, stopping at the first match.
# Scoreboards:
# - Scoreboards are defined in the "scoreboards.yml" file.
# - Scoreboard name is the same as defined in the scoreboards configuration node name.
# - The leftmost scoreboard in the list always takes priority.
worlds:
  # If player doesn't meet the conditions to see the conditional scoreboard then it will display the simple scoreboard
  world_the_end: [ 'world_the_end' ]
  world_nether: [ 'world_nether' ]
  world: [ 'world']
  # This will match all worlds starting with "world_" (e.g. world_nether, world_the_end)
  # "world_the_end" will never reach this line since it already matched above
  world_\w*: [ 'customTiming' ]
  # This will match all worlds that haven't been defined above
  \w*: [ '' ]
